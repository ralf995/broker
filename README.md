# Broker

This is a very basic implementation of an MQTT broker developed as a [unikernel](http://unikernel.org/) for the Raspberry Pi.
It was developed using the [Circle](https://github.com/rsta2/circle) library, which enables the generation of executable images for the Raspberry Pi as bare-metal applications.
